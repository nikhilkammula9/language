I have learned a about writing methods. Some of my notes for the using the methods are : 
To define a method, you must declare its return type, name, and parameters. When calling a method, you use the method's name, followed by a dot and parentheses. The parameters, which are the inputs to the method, are declared in parentheses in the method signature. Additionally, methods can be used to change the value of an instance field. Variables are limited in scope to the domain in which they are created. Finally, the return type of the variables that will be output by the method is declared in the method declaration.
here is the example program to practice[methods example} https://github.com/nikhilkammula9/language/blob/main/Progress/SavingAccount.java

I have also created calculator program here the [link]https://github.com/nikhilkammula9/language/blob/main/Progress/Calculator.java

Next, i have learned about the conditional statements and conditional operators 
Conditional statements allow us to create different program paths based on certain conditions. The basic structure involves an "if" clause followed by a code block to be executed if the condition is true, and an optional "else" clause with a code block to be executed if the condition is false.

The different types of conditional statements behave as follows:
```
1. if
2. if-else
3. if-else nested
4. switch
```
Here is my practice [program] https://github.com/nikhilkammula9/language/blob/main/Progress/Order.java

My notes on Conditional operators 
1. Conditional operators simplify code by working on boolean values. They can be used with conditional statements to consolidate branching logic.
2. The Conditional-AND operator, &&, returns true only if both the booleans on its left and right sides are true.
For example, if (true && false) returns false, while if (true && true) returns true.
3. The Conditional-OR operator, ||, returns true if one or both of the booleans on either side is true.
For example, if (false || false) returns false, while if (false || true) returns true.
4. The Logical-NOT operator, !, returns the opposite boolean value of its operand.
For example, if (!false) returns true, while if (!true) returns false.

I had a big problem understanding methods, parameters used in methods and how to implement them but thorugh rigours practise and implementation I able to undersrtand how the method works
