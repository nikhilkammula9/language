This week i started to learn about arrays and arrays lists.Arrays are a data structure that allows you to store a fixed number of values of the same type in contiguous memory locations. This means that arrays can hold values of various data types, such as doubles, integers, booleans, characters, strings, and even user-defined data types, as long as all the values in the array are of the same type.
```
Example : String[] Articles = {"Oil", "Invention", "Computers", "Vegetables", "Unknown World"};
    int[] Viewers = {87, 32, 13, 11, 7};
    double[] Ratings = {2.5, 3.2, 5.0, 1.7, 4.3};
```
In java we use **import java.util.Arrays;** to import Array packages
For Printing the above String we use toString() method which is available in Array Package
