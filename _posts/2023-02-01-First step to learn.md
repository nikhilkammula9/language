Here is how I started it. I'm using ChatGPT to help me with the learning process. It provided starting steps to get started. So, I decided to follow the steps provided by chatGPT and I have Installed the Java Development Kit and by watching a few videos on YouTube I learned to install java packages on Visual studio to write and test the code. I started to learn basic syntax and keywords. Here are my notes: 

1. At least one class in the program should be the same as the filename. I have written  

- Example is if a class name is **FirstProgram** then the Filename should be **FirstProgram.java** 

 2. The main method should be written under a class, and it must be written for any application. In my first program I used '''public static void main(String[] args){ }'''  

-It only accepts strings here in this case 

-main method must be started with **{** and ended with **}** 

3. The syntax we use for print statement is **System.out.print("OUR PRINT STATEMENTS ");** 

For these Print Statements what I learnt is  

- while executing my first program is that System is case sensitive 

- Print Statement must be ended with semi colon **;** 

- If we use **System.out.println** instead of **System.out.print** we get statement in a different line. 

4. We can write comments in java program by using **//** for single line comments and  /* â€¦. */  for multiple lines. 

5. For compiling the file we use javac '''Filename.java '''

6. or executing the file we use '''java filename''' (here we filename.java because after compilation, **.java** is converted to **.class** file)
