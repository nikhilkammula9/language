**Welcome to my blog about learning a new programming language** 

I have decided to learn **JAVA** programming language. When I first started Java during my bachelors, I wasn't sure how JAVA programming could be that important. Whenever I came across a job opening or an internship oppurtunity, majority of the companies were looking for someone who is good in JAVA and I see myself lacking behind. So, I want to utilize this oppurtunity and learn the language.
