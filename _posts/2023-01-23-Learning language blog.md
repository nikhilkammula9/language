**Welcome to my blog about learning a new programming language** 

I'm Nikhil Kammula, a computer science graduate student at Saint Louis University. This semester, I've decided to learn **JAVA** programming. When I first started learning the language during my undergrad days, I didn't think it was that important. But as I've been looking for job and internship opportunities, I've noticed that many companies want candidates who are proficient in JAVA. Even when I was browsing websites to learn a new function or format, I noticed that Java was often used in examples. It became clear to me that JAVA is widely used and essential for many tasks. So, I want utilize my time this semester to become proficient in JAVA Programming.
