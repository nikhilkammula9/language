I have start to read about the variables in Java and I found that Variables in Java play important role in manipulating and storing the data. I have learn to implement them in java programming. Just to make notes I have learnt the implementation of the follwing variables.
```
Boolean Data Type
String Data Type
Int Data Type
Char Data Type
Primitive Data Types
Static Typing
Final Keyword
Double Data Type
Math Operations
Comparison Operators
Compound Assignment Operators
Increment and Decrement Operators
Order of Operations
```
I have Practise them all separately but at the end i have written a small code which covers almost all of the Variable.
