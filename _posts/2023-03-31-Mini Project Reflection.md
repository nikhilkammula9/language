The Mini Project which we worked on is Smart Fridge Receipe. The Smart Fridge Recipe Project is a useful tool for people who want to simplify their meal planning and preparation. The project provides a range of recipe options to choose from, along with the necessary ingredients to make the selected dish.
One of the standout features of this project is its ability to check the user's fridge to see if all the necessary ingredients are already available. If not, the project will create a shopping list for the user to purchase the missing ingredients, making it easier to plan and shop for meals.
Moreover, the Smart Fridge Recipe Project keeps track of the contents of the fridge and the available recipes in separate files, which can be accessed again with ease. This allows users to quickly and conveniently find the recipes they want to make and check if they have all the necessary ingredients.
Overall, the Smart Fridge Recipe Project is a great way to simplify meal planning and make cooking more accessible and enjoyable for people of all skill levels.

While working on this project I got a chance to have a recap of methods, conditonals statements, access modifiers, variables and datatypes. I had to revisit all of these to successfully implement this mini project. Moreover, From this Project I have learned about Exceptionals Handling. Often Java programs are interrupted by exceptions. But using exceptional handling we can resolve the problem. We have try, catch, throw and finally blocks in exceptional handling.
Where **catch** is used to catch the thrown exception. **try** has code that can be thrown. **finally** is used to execute the code regardless of what exception may occur.

Challeges that I had faced while working on this project is consuming a lot of time in reviewing all the concepts that I studied earlier in this semester and Understanding how exceptional handling works.
